      <h6>
        FRIENDSHIP 2.0 was launched in December 2021 as the second phase of
        the": Project for Future Researchers at IITH to Enhance Network
        Development with Scholarship of Japan in the Republic of India
        (FRIENDSHIP) Project," which was implemented by the Japan International
        Cooperation Agency (JICA) since 2012 to promote industry-university
        collaboration between Japan and India FRIENDSHIP 2.0 aims to build a
        sustainable platform for academic and industrial collaboration between
        Japan and India at IITH, and to ensure that the human resources produced
        from this platform will continuously contribute to the academic and
        industrial development of both countries. We will also promote
        Japan-India collaboration from the perspective of Make in India and
        SDGs. As part of this effort, we have established the Japan Desk within
        IITH as a one-stop contact point for all information related to
        Japan-India collaboration, including study in Japan and joint research.
